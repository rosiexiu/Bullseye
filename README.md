Weighing & Dispensing 

Weighing and Dispending the right quantity of material prior to the manufacturing process is a key activity in LED Packaging and other proocess industries. The process is critical when operating with LED phospher powders whcih exhibit the phenonmenon of luminescence in making mixture of A/B Glues and the powders. Decimal errors in the "glue and powder mixture" calculation would not be able to tuning phosphors for better white light. Advances in the weighing boost the efficiency and appeal better light in LED bulbs. Companies preweigh materials to aim better color of LED lights and to assure rapid delivery at the critical stages of LED packaging process.

Seira-5 lets your produce the mixture in several modes of operation with full label printing capabilities. Functionality supported includes:

  *Weighing and Dispending Modes
  *METTLER TOLEDO Weigh Module (accurate to 0.0001)
  *Tolerances
  *Operating Alarm Prompt
  *Label Printing 
  *Equipment Maintenance
